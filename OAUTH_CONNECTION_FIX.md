# Kakao OAuth Connection Refused Fix

## Problem Analysis
- Server is running correctly on localhost:5000
- OAuth callback route exists and responds properly
- Browser shows "connection refused" during Kakao redirect
- This is a browser/network level issue, not server configuration

## Root Causes
1. **Browser Security**: Some browsers block localhost redirects from external domains
2. **Network Interface**: IPv6/IPv4 binding conflicts
3. **Firewall/Proxy**: Local security software blocking connections
4. **Browser Cache**: Stale DNS or connection cache

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Force IPv4 Resolution
The server binds to 0.0.0.0 but browsers may try IPv6 first, causing connection failures.

### Solution 2: Alternative Localhost Addresses
Use different localhost representations that may bypass browser restrictions:
- 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
- localhost.localdomain
- [::1] for IPv6

### Solution 3: Browser-Specific Fixes
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Disable browser security extensions temporarily
- Use different browsers for testing

## Implementation Strategy
Since the server and route are working correctly, we need to ensure the redirect URI registration matches exactly what the browser can connect to.
