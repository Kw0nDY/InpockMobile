How to Provide Requirements to Replit Based on Cursor's Feedback
Here’s a well-structured English version you can use to communicate your requirements to Replit, based on what Cursor requested:

1. API/DB Design
Please specify the structure of the settings data you want to save/load (e.g., profile, notifications, language preferences, etc.).

Share your preferred DB schema (e.g., User, Settings, Subscription collections/tables) and the fields/types you want for each.

Provide API specifications you need (e.g., /api/settings, /api/profile), including example requests and responses if possible.

2. UI/UX
Describe the user flow for each feature (e.g., profile editing, security, subscriptions): what actions should be possible, and what screens/buttons should trigger them.

If you have a design guide (colors, buttons, layout, etc.), please share it.

List any expected error/exception cases (e.g., password change failure, subscription expired, etc.).

3. Integrations/Policies
Subscription/Payment: Which payment service do you plan to use (e.g., Stripe, Toss, etc.)? Any specific policies?

Notifications/Email: Which external service will you use (e.g., Firebase, custom SMTP, etc.)?

Two-factor authentication: What method do you prefer (SMS, email, OTP, etc.)?

4. Other
Internationalization (i18n): What languages do you want to support? Please provide sample translation files if available.

Roles/Permissions: Do you need to distinguish between admin and general users?

Testing/Deployment: Any specific environments or policies for testing and deployment?

5. Example Materials
Wireframes or design mockups (Figma, images, etc.).

Sample data for settings/profile/subscription (JSON, etc.).

Reference sites or services you want to model after.

Conclusion
Providing any of the above information will help us work faster and more accurately.
If you don’t have specific requirements or examples, we can proceed with standard SaaS/mobile service conventions.
