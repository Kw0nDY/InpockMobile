# Kakao OAuth Final Configuration Fix

## Critical Update Required in Kakao Developers Console

Your current configuration shows domain/platform mismatches causing the "localhost refused to connect" error.

### Required Changes:

1. **Platform Settings (플랫폼 → Web)**
   - Current: `http://127.0.0.1` 
   - **Change to:** `http://localhost:5000`

2. **Redirect URI (카카오 로그인 → Redirect URI)**
   - Current: `http://localhost:5000/oauth/kakao/callback` (this is correct)
   - **Keep as:** `http://localhost:5000/oauth/kakao/callback`

### Why This Fix Works:
- Eliminates browser compatibility issues between 127.0.0.1 and localhost
- Ensures consistent domain handling across all OAuth steps
- Resolves redirect URI validation failures

### After Making These Changes:
1. Save all settings in Kakao Developers Console
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for propagation
3. Test the OAuth flow again

The server is now configured to use `localhost:5000` consistently for maximum browser compatibility.
